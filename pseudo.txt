// This is a script for the Dead and Buried game system

// Attack Function (attacker token name/id, defender token name/id)
// It handles a creature (attacker) attacking another creature (defender)
//1. Retrieve current Attack skill attribute for the Attacker
//      If above 24 then cap to 24
//      If <= 0 then no attack to be made, go to 7
//2. Retrieve current Defense skill attribute for the Defender
//     If above 20 then cap to 20
//3. Roll 1d20
//     If 20 then Fumble
//     Else if Attack skill - Roll is equal or more than Defense skill then Hit
//     Else Miss
//4. Resolve Fumble
//5. Reduce Attack skill of Attacker by 24
//6. Reduce Defense skill of Defender by 20
//7. Announce outcome of attack in chat

// New Round Function
// Handles the replenishment of Attack and Defense skills for all tokens.
//  Post "NEW ROUND" to chat
//  For each token on map
//      Increase Attack skill attribute to maximum
//      Increase Defense skill attribute to maximum
//      Increase Init attribute to maximum + 1d20
//      Set value of tokens turn order to Init attribute + "." + 1d20 + 1d20 (sets value to 4dp)
//      Call Deterioration Function
//      Call Bleeding Function
//      Post request to apply regen to chat

// Deterioration Function (token name/id)
//  Retrieves Deteriorating wound attribute
//  If Deteriorating wounds > 0 then
//      Retrieves System shock attribute for token
//      If D100 > (System shock - (3% * Deteriorating wounds)) then
//          If Deteriorating wounds >= 12 OR Unconscious attribute = 1 then token = Dead (apply skull and crossbones image)
//          Else Unconscious attribute = 1
//      Else nothing

// Bleeding Function (token name/id)
//  Retrieves Bleeding wounds attribute
//  if Bleeding wounds > 0 then
//      Reduce HP attribute current value by (Bleeding wounds / 2) **note (Bleeding wounds / 2) should round down
//      Add (Bleeding wounds / 2) to current value of Deteriorating wounds attribute **note (Bleeding wounds / 2) should round down

Character sheet creation function

Function needs to allow me to enter part of a token name, and then create the character sheet for all tokens that have that string in the name. I.e. Goblin 1, Goblin 2, Goblin 3 would only require me to enter “Goblin”.

Attributes to be added to all character sheets.
Character sheet to be attached to tokens created on the map.
Ideally bar 1 on token to be linked to the HP attribute.
All values with “?” as the value need to be set from a dialogue or as input parameters.

Attribute list:
Attack skill 1 (?) – need to be able to tell it how many attacks to create and what values for each
Defense skill (?)
HP (and tie this to bar 1 on the token) (?)
Init (?)
Body (calculated as [((Strength + Constitution) / 2) -3]) (rounds up)
Dodge (calculated as [((Dexterity + Perception) / 2) -3]) (rounds up)
Mind (calculated as [((Intelligence + Wisdom) / 2) -3]) (rounds up)
Special (calculated as [((Strength + Dexterity + Constitution + Intelligence + Wisdom + Memory + Perception) / 7) -3]) (rounds up)
Strength (?)
Dexterity (?)
Constitution (?)
Intelligence (?)
Wisdom (?)
Charisma (?)
Memory (?)
Perception (?)
Bleeding wounds (0/0)
Bandaged wounds (0/0)
Deteriorating wounds (0/0)
Wound Penalty (0/0)
System shock (?) – this could be a lookup based on Constitution the table is called Statistic Adjustments on page 86 of the rule book
Unconscious (0/0)
